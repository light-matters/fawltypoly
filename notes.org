#+title: Notes

* * Problems
** accessing prop collection
had issues accessing (by index and by name)
** Python path
The package root is not necessarily on the Python path and so requiring other namespaces can be a problem
** Module loading (NameError: name 'basilisp_core' is not defined)
Had some recurring and really weird problems regarding using a second module (interop) from another (object).

Fundamentally,
(get {:a 5} :a) worked from the interop namespace, but
(i/get {:a 5} :a) in the object namespace caused the error.

Following these steps below seems to resolve the issue but I don't understand why each is necessary.

** What works
*** start blender
#+begin_src zsh
cd  #Need to make sure that I'm in the home directory.
blender
#+end_src

*** basilisp blender extension
- set project dir to fawltypoly root
- START SERVER

*** Run these commands in the basilisp REPL
 #+begin_src clojure
    (import os)
    (.chdir os "/home/ctw/Python/fawltypoly")
    (load-file "fawltypoly/interop.lpy")
    (load-file "fawltypoly/object.lpy")
    (require '[fawltypoly.object :as o])
    (require '[fawltypoly.interop :as i])

    (i/get {:a 5} :a)
 #+end_src
** What doesn't
