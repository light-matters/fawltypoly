This library is an alternative API for the [Blender](blender.org) graphics tool. It is built on-top of[basilisp-blender](https://github.com/ikappaki/basilisp-blender), the REPL-enabling tool for blender, which is itself built on the [basilisp](https://github.com/basilisp-lang/basilisp?tab=readme-ov-file) language, a Python implementation of Clojure (ish).


## Status
Entirely exploratory, providing no guarantees at all! I'm currently playing with it for personal projects, but with an eye to reusability.

## Etymology
Just for fun.

The name comes from the combination of Basilisp and Blender, but you have to know a few things to get the connection... Basil and Polly are main characters in the British sitcom 'FawltyTowers' and are played by Monty Python actors. Monty Python, not the snake, is actually the original inspiration for the name of the 'Python' programming language. Polygons are fundamental to Blender. And, to cap it off, we're dealing with a bridge between two languages and blender and a lot of the humour in Fawlty Towers comes from the communication problems between the characters, particularly when a certain Spanish waiter is involved.
